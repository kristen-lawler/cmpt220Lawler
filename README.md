This repository consists of various projects completed during 
a Software Development course my senior year of college. All files in this 
repository utilize Java; learning this language was the focus of the course.
For Project 2, the final project for the class, I created a solution
using Java to a famous problem in mathematics: the stable marriage problem.
This essentially asks is there a way to "stably" pair individuals in a 
population considering each individual's preference of a potential "mate"? 
Such a pairing can be achieved through iterations of "proposals" based 
upon one side of the given popuation's lists of preferences. The proposals are 
either accepted or rejected based upon the preferences of those who were 
proposed to. Following the work of David Gale and Lloyd Shapley who gave and 
verified an answer to this problem, I utilized Java to simulate the solution. 
Additionally, this program accepts user inputs to determine the size of the 
population based upon the number of "suitors" and their possible mates as well 
as a list of preference of the user. A full breakdown of this project can be 
found in the Project 2 folder.
